# Brett's Resume Website

## Really? Custom software for a resume website?

Yeah, taking 45 minutes to build this on Wix or SquareSpace would have been far easier. But in addition to just being my resume website, this project serves as a demonstration of my skillset. Throughout this repository, you'll find clear and annotated code that should help you get a better understanding of how this all comes together to work.

## What will I find here?

You'll find a simple full-stack application running React on the frontend, and Node on the backend. The codebase uses TypeScript throughout.

There's also a neat integration made with Contentful, which is the CMS that hosts most of the website's textual content and images. In this case, Contentful is playing the role of a traditional database.

There's a small AWS component that utilizes CloudFront as a CDN for static assets (JS/CSS).
